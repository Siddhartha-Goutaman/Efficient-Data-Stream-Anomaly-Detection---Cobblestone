# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection---Cobblestone
Research project by Siddhartha Goutaman as part of job application to Cobblestone.

The project demanded the development of a Python script for anomaly detection in continuously streamed data - simulating real-time sequences of financial transactions or system metrics.

The project was successfully completed using 3 different algorithms and 2 methods for statistical calculations. 
The algorithms used in anomaly detection are:
  a. Z-score based detection
  b. EWMA (Exponentially Weight Moving Average) 
  c. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

A more detailed explanation of the different methods is as follows
# Z-score based detection
This method makes use of the z-score which is a statistical measure that describes how far a particular data point is from the mean of the data, measured in standard deviations. It's calculated as: $`\frac{x-μ}{σ}`$
